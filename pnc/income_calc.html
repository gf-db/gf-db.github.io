Weight setting and some other things currently don't work.<br>
XP, DGC, Skill points and Intimacy are measured in thousands.<br>
Content drops of basic tickets/skill boxes are my own pull averages and

Fragment part of the calculation only works as an average over everyone.
It is very deceptive and worse than it looks for raising specific dolls<br>
