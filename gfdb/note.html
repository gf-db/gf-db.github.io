Since 01 Nov 2020 game servers aggressively cache craft list results and return new data only 20 times per day. This significantly reduces capture rate and accuracy/precision of gfdb. There is nothing end users can do about it.
<br>
Since 24 Nov 2020 after the maintenance the old (good) behaviour is back.
<br>
Since 07 Nov 2021 the problem returned. This is best visible on the <a href="../charts/charts.html?data=equ_light_crafts">equip chart page</a>.
<br>
Since 16 Nov 2021 after the maintenance the results are fixed once again.
<br>
Since 09 May 2023 after the maintenance all observer accounts stopped working and trying to register new users results in infinite waits in queue. Capture cannot continue until developers fix this.
<br>
Since 10 May 2023 the queue problem happens less often, although it did not disappear entirely. Capture resumed.
<br>
Since 03 Aug 2023 game servers completely stopped renewing craft list results and return the same log every time. There is nothing end users can do about it.
<br>
Since 07 Aug 2023 the log updates resumed.
